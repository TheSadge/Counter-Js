<h1><b>Countdown Timer with Circular Progress Bar</b></h1>
This project is a simple countdown timer application implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The timer counts down from a user-specified number of seconds, displaying the remaining time and progress as a circular progress bar. The key features and functionality of this project include:

User Input for Countdown: Users can input the number of seconds they want the timer to count down from.

Circular Progress Bar: A dynamic circular progress bar visually represents the percentage of time remaining. The progress bar updates in real-time as the timer counts down.

Error Handling: The application checks if the user input is a valid number and displays an error message if it's not.

UI State Management: The UI changes state based on the timer's progress. For example, it shows a "Wait ..." message during the countdown and a success message upon completion.

Start and Cancel Functionality: The start button initiates the countdown. If clicked again while the timer is running, it reloads the page to cancel the countdown.

Refresh Button: A refresh button is displayed after the countdown completes, allowing the user to reset the application easily.

This project demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic styling to create an interactive and user-friendly countdown timer. It is a great starting point for those looking to learn more about JavaScript and front-end web development.
